## My process

- Analyzed the design
- Added the needed tags and classes in the HTML code]
- Wrapped the elements in a div
- Used a CSS Grid and properties on the div to center it
- Styled the classes to make the elements look similiar to the required design 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned that this is a nice way to center stuff.

```css
  body { 
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    }   
```
And I also learned that min-content and fit-content are good for setting the width and height
of the div that stored the elements

### Continued development

I am new to HTML, CSS and writing code in general so I want to learn useful properties that I can use in other projects


### Useful resources

- [Creating a neon button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xNcXwC6ikQ&t=78s) - Kevin Powell is
very informative when it comes to CSS. I used the code laid out at the start of this video to help
me center everything.
